During her student time, she realized that a lot of students cannot afford to buy new textbooks and the queue to borrow such textbooks from university library was always very long. As a student, she constantly thought of opening a used bookstore where students can buy textbooks at an affordable price. As soon as her graduation, she started to realised her idea: to open a used bookstore in Montreal. She teamed up with a data analyst team to find out where is the optimal place in Montreal to locate the bookstore.\n",
